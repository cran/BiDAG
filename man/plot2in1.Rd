\title{Highlighting similarities between two graphs}
\usage{
plot2in1(graph1, graph2, name1 = NULL, name2 = NULL, bidir = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph1}{binary adjacency matrix of a graph}

\item{graph2}{binary adjacency matrix of a graph, column names should coincide with column names of 'graph1'}

\item{name1}{character, custom name for 'graph1'; when NULL no legend will be plotted}

\item{name2}{character, custom name for 'graph2'}

\item{bidir}{logical, defines if arrows of bidirected edges are drawn; FALSE by defauls.}

\item{...}{optional parameters passed to \pkg{Rgraphviz} plotting functions e.g. \code{main}, \code{fontsize}}
}
\value{
plots the graph which includes nodes and edges two graphs; nodes which are connected to at least one other node in both graphs are plotted only once and coloured orange, edges which are shared by two graphs
are coloured orange; all other nodes and edges a plotted once for each 'graph1' and 'graph2' and coloured blue and green accordingly.
}
\description{
This function plots nodes and edges from two graphs in one and indicates similarities between these graphs.
